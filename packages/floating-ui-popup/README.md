This is an package for popup components. Using [floating-ui](https://floating-ui.com/) as a base. Includes normal components likes modals, popovers, tooltips. Also includes more complex components like a popconfirm, dialog, etc.
All components are fully customizable, SSR ready and can be used with any React framework (Next, Remix).
You can find the storybook [here](https://floating-ui.com/).

## Problems

* **Portal and positioning:** the popup should be rendered in a portal to avoid z-index problems and popup should be positioned relative to the trigger. [floating-ui](https://floating-ui.com/) solves this problem very well. üéâ
* **Interactive and accessible:** dealing with focus, restore focus, keyboard events, and WAI-ARIA support is hard. [floating-ui](https://floating-ui.com/) also provides a good solution for this.ü•≥
* **Customize:** customizing the popup like positioning, animation, and styling required a lot of effort. We might need to override a lot of CSS to achieve the desired result. ü´†
* **Implement trade-off:** Using UI libraries like Antd, Material-UI might help us, but sometimes we just need some components like Modal or Tooltips, and also need to modify the component to adapt the design. Or creating your own components but it will take a lot of time and effort.üòê


## Installation

React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:

* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.
* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.
* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react).

## Documentation

You can find the React documentation [on the website](https://react.dev/).

Check out the [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn) page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)
* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)

You can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).

## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:

### Modal

```jsx
import { Modal } from '@kai/floating-ui-popup';

function MyModal(props) {
  return <Modal {...props}>Hello World</Modal>;
}
```

This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.
